# MinHash All the Things

## Use cases

* search the SRA <- for an unassembled sample, or for a metagenome overlap, or b/c we want to do a new assembly

* start from an SRA sample -> find assemblies or matches to that

* chain to new analyses of same dataset (‘find lisa’s latest reassembly’)

* metagenome breakdown based on protein  

* find things that you could/should co-assemble (DNA overlap)

* contamination analysis of supposedly pure samples (“give me the first non-dog match”)

* one-stop-shop for searching all the archives 

* grey and dark data indexing and search and estimation

## Services to provide

* automatic linkage between SRA and samples

* surveillance mode of the SRA

* estimate size of dark data space based on searches

* upload 1m reads => sig
